I am a first-year PhD student from [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk). I obtained my Master's Degree from a joint degree program between [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg) and [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). I also hold two Bachelor's Degrees from both University of Birmingham and Southwest Jiaotong University. My research interests include Power System Operation and Planning, Smart Grid, and Power System Distribution Systems.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Dr. WANG Qin of AIIES Lab from Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, PolyU.
